# This is a sample configuration for canopen.

# When loading a configuration, everything coming after a “#“ will be cut.
# Also, (then) empty lines will be ignored.

# Each line (that is not to be ignored) starts with
# a keyword, seperated by one or more spaces/tabs from the
# key, which is seperated by one or more spaces/tabs from the
# value, which is the entire rest of the line.

# The keywords are “alias”, “setting”, “mime” and “pattern”.



# “alias” allows to define an alias for a specific command. Just define the
# key to be a certain expression, and you may use it as a value to define
# commands for files that match a certain pattern or are of a certain
# mime-type.

# Please replace my-favourite-texteditor with *your* favourite text-editor!
alias   TEXT   my-favourite-texteditor

# You can leave this one alone. It is used to simply ignore files.
alias   IGNORE   true

# Aliases can refer to other aliases, universalopen will check for loops.
# Although not required, is recommended to use only capital letters for
# the names of aliases.



# “mime” defines, which command is used to open a file of the respective
# mime-type. If the key is just an expression without a slash (“/”), then
# the command in question is used for all sub-types.
#
# If they key does contain a slash, the command is used for the type/subtype.
# A definition with type/subtype always takes precedence over a definition
# with just the type.

# This one makes every text to be opened with the command defined above.
mime   text   TEXT



# A “pattern” defines a pattern as used in Unix shells to match file-names.
# All patterns are, however, case-insensitive.

# Ignore backup-files and a few others
pattern   *~      IGNORE
pattern   *.tmp   IGNORE
pattern   *.bac   IGNORE
pattern   *.bak   IGNORE



# A “setting” defines internal options depending on the key,
# “loadconfig” loads an additional configuration from ~/.config/canopen
# “messenger” defines an external program to display error-messages
# “fallback” defines which command to use for files no match was found for.

# you might uncomment the following line if you have gmessage installed:
#setting   messenger   gxmessage -title canopen -buttons OK:0 -default OK -wrap
